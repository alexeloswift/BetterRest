# BetterRest
This is an app for coffee drinkers who want to find out what they're ideal bedtime is. This was a part of my SwiftUI course.

In this app my challenges were:

Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!

Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.

Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font.
